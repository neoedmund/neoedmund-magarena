Magarena 
========
Homepage: http://magarena.googlecode.com
Forum: http://www.slightlymagic.net/forum/viewforum.php?f=82

Requirements: Java Runtime 6 (http://java.com) must be installed on your computer

Starting Magarena:
  On Windows, double click on Magarena.exe
  On Linux, execute ./Magarena.sh. 
  On Mac, double click the Magarena icon

Magarena supports the following keyboard shortcuts :
  Space   or Right key : action button
  Escape  or Left key  : undo button
  F1      or M key     : show or hide game messages
  Y key                : yes button
  N key                : no button

Selecting the AI to play against:
  The desired AI can be selected in the "New duel" dialog (Arena -> New duel).

  Default is minimax. AI difficulty level for the best balance of speed and
  strength is the default 6.

  The Monte Carlo AI spends at most N seconds to consider each move, where N is
  the AI difficulty level. It is the strongest AI available, however it cheats
  as it has knowledge of all cards in the game.

  The Vegas AI should be fast on all difficulty levels.
