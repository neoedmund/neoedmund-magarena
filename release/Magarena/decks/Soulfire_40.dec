>This one doesn't nearly always work, but when it does, it's spectacular. The idea is to throw out amplified and duplicated mass destruction spells, but resist their detrimental effects yourself. A bit of life gain so you end up a couple of points higher than dead. Your creatures have protection so they don't get burned.
