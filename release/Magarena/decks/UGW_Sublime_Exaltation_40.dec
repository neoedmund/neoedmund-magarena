>A deck build around the Exalted ability. The result is surprisingly effective, at least against creature-heavy decks (which Magarena is based around). Defensively not so hot, though, and burn decks will eat you. This deck also makes use of those three-colored rares you've probably thought cool but could never fit in a deck, like Rafiq of the Many and Nulltread Gargantuan. Oh, and Serra Angel, just 'cause.
