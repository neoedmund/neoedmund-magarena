>A green-white deck built around a lot of cheap auras and creatures that love them: Kor Spiritdancer, Yavimaya Enchantress and even Thran Golem. Beastmaster's Magemark has never been so useful! The AI will likely enchant the wrong creatures that don't benefit from auras, or spread the auras around instead of stacking them all on one creature.
