There must be a Java Runtime 6 (java.com) installed on your computer to play.
Installing on Windows is quite simple, just put Magarena.exe on your desktop and execute.
To execute the jar instead, use java -Xmx256m -jar Magarena.jar.

Do not forget to execute Download images in the Arena menu the first time you run a new release.
Otherwise you will see a lot of question marks.

Have fun!
